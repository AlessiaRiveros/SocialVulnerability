# Assessing Social Vulnerability and Equity Methods
## Context
Current flood risk assessments are aimed at calculating the total damage caused by different flood events. Direct damages are calculated based on the maximum potential damage and flood damage curves. Flood risks and damages are usually aggregated over the area or presented at different spatial scales. Such aggregated assessments obscures how outcomes (in our case, flood risk and damages) are distributed across people and space. Also, damages have a different impact on utility for poor versus rich people (e.g. a dollar for a poor person has much more value/utility than for a rich person). As a result, equity and social vulnerability considerations are not included in the assessments.

## Case Study
Our case study is Santa Cruz, Bolivia. We use the total damages computed using FIAT at the building level for two flooding events for return period T=2 and T=10 provided by the Santa Cruz Bolivia project.

## Methods
We focus on how the methods chosen affect the outcomes and the policy prioritization.
### Equity Weighting Method
We explore two simple aggregation methods of the total damages (sum and average) for the residential buildings to the AZONE level.
We build on this by comparing the total damages with the equity weighted total damages for the residential buildings at the AZONE level.

### Wellbeing Method
We are working on applying the wellbeing method (cf. Hallegatte) at the AZONE level and at the household level.
